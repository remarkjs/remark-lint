## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that the spacing between list item markers
and content is inconsistent.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'mixed'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) | `'tab-size'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-list-item-indent
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintListItemIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-list-item-indent@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintListItemIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-list-item-indent@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintListItemIndent from 'remark-lint-list-item-indent'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintListItemIndent)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-list-item-indent example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-list-item-indent",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintListItemIndent`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintListItemIndent[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'tab-size'`) are accepted:

*   `'space'`
    â€” prefer a single space
*   `'tab-size'`
    â€” prefer spaces the size of the next tab stop
*   `'mixed'`
    â€” prefer `'space'` for tight lists and `'tab-size'` for loose lists

## Recommendation

First, some background.
The number of spaces that occur after list markers (`*`, `-`, and `+` for
unordered lists, or `.` and `)` for unordered lists) and before the content
on the first line, defines how much indentation can be used for further
lines.
At least one space is required and up to 4 spaces are allowed (if there is no
further content after the marker then itâ€™s a blank line which is handled as
if there was one space; if there are 5 or more spaces and then content, itâ€™s
also seen as one space and the rest is seen as indented code).

There are two types of lists in markdown (other than ordered and unordered):
tight and loose lists.
Lists are tight by default but if there is a blank line between two list
items or between two blocks inside an item, that turns the whole list into a
loose list.
When turning markdown into HTML, paragraphs in tight lists are not wrapped
in `<p>` tags.

Historically, how indentation of lists works in markdown has been a mess,
especially with how they interact with indented code.
CommonMark made that a *lot* better, but there remain (documented but
complex) edge cases and some behavior intuitive.
Due to this, the default of this list is `'tab-size'`, which worked the best
in most markdown parsers.
Currently, the situation between markdown parsers is better, so choosing
`'space'` (which seems to be the most common style used by authors) should
be okay.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
uses `'tab-size'` (named `'tab'` there) by default.
[`listItemIndent: '1'` (for `'space'`) or `listItemIndent: 'mixed'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionslistitemindent)
is supported.
