## What is this?

![](screenshot.png)

You can use this to check markdown.
Say we have a markdown file `doc/example.md` that contains:

```markdown
1) Hello, _Jupiter_ and *Neptune*!
```

Then assuming we installed dependencies and run:

```sh
npx remark doc/ --use remark-preset-lint-consistent --use remark-preset-lint-recommended
```

We would get a report like this:

```text
doc/example.md
1:2           warning Unexpected ordered list marker `)`, expected `.`                  ordered-list-marker-style remark-lint
1:25-1:34     warning Unexpected emphasis marker `*`, expected `_`                      emphasis-marker           remark-lint
  [cause]:
    1:11-1:20 info    Emphasis marker style `'_'` first defined for `'consistent'` here emphasis-marker           remark-lint

⚠ 2 warnings
```

This GitHub repository is a monorepo that contains ±70 plugins (each a rule that
checks one specific thing) and 3 presets (combinations of rules configured to
check for certain styles).

These packages are build on [unified][] ([remark][]).
**unified** is a project that inspects and transforms content with abstract
syntax trees (ASTs).
**remark** adds support for markdown to unified.
**mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses.
These lint rules inspect mdast.

## When should I use this?

This project is useful when developers or technical writers are authoring
documentation in markdown and you want to ensure that the markdown is
consistent, free of bugs, and works well across different markdown parsers.

These packages are quite good at checking markdown.
They especially shine when combined with other [remark plugins][remark-plugin]
and at letting you make your own rules.

## Presets

Presets are combinations of rules configured to check for certain styles.
The following presets only contain lint rules but you can make your own that
include any remark plugins or other presets.
The presets that are maintained here:

<!--presets start-->

* [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) — rules that enforce consistency
* [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) — rules that enforce the markdown style guide
* [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) — rules that prevent mistakes or stuff that fails across vendors.

<!--presets end-->

For help creating your own rule, it’s suggested to look at existing rules and to
[follow this tutorial][tutorial].

## Configure

<!--Old ID of this section:-->

<a name="configuring-remark-lint"></a>

All rules can be configured in one standard way:

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLintFinalNewline from 'remark-lint-final-newline'
import remarkLintMaximumLineLength from 'remark-lint-maximum-line-length'
import remarkLintUnorderedListMarkerStyle from 'remark-lint-unordered-list-marker-style'

remark()
  // Pass `false` to turn a rule off — the code no longer runs:
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, false)
  // Pass `true` to turn a rule on again:
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, true)
  // You can also configure whether messages by the rule should be ignored,
  // are seen as code style warnings (default), or are seen as exceptions.
  // Ignore messages with `'off'` or `0` as the first value of an array:
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, ['off'])
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, [0])
  // Use `'warn'`, `'on'`, or `1` to treat messages as code style warnings:
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, ['warn'])
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, ['on'])
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, [1])
  // Use `'error'` or `2` to treat messages as exceptions:
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, ['error'])
  .use(remarkLintFinalNewline, [2])
  // Some rules accept options, and what they exactly accept is different for
  // each rule (sometimes a string, a number, or an object).
  // The following rule accepts a string:
  .use(remarkLintUnorderedListMarkerStyle, '*')
  .use(remarkLintUnorderedListMarkerStyle, ['on', '*'])
  .use(remarkLintUnorderedListMarkerStyle, [1, '*'])
  // The following rule accepts a number:
  .use(remarkLintMaximumLineLength, 72)
  .use(remarkLintMaximumLineLength, ['on', 72])
  .use(remarkLintMaximumLineLength, [1, 72])
```

See [`use()` in `unified`s readme][unified-use] for more info on how to use
plugins.

> 🧑‍🏫 **Info**: messages in `remark-lint` are warnings instead of errors.
> Other linters (such as ESLint) almost always use errors.
> Why?
> Those tools *only* check code style.
> They don’t generate, transform, and format code, which is what remark and
> unified focus on, too.
> Errors in unified mean the same as an exception in your JavaScript code: a
> crash.
> That’s why we use warnings instead, because we continue checking more markdown
> and continue running more plugins.

## Ignore warnings

You can use HTML comments to hide or show warnings from within markdown.
Turn off all remark lint messages with `<!--lint disable-->` and turn them on
again with `<!--lint enable-->`:

```markdown
<!--lint disable-->

[Naiad]: https://naiad.neptune

[Thalassa]: https://thalassa.neptune

<!--lint enable-->
```

You can toggle specific rules by using their names without `remark-lint-`:

```markdown
<!--lint disable no-unused-definitions definition-case-->

[Naiad]: https://naiad.neptune

[Thalassa]: https://thalassa.neptune

<!--lint enable no-unused-definitions definition-case-->
```

You can ignore a message in the next block with `<!--lint ignore-->`:

```markdown
<!--lint ignore-->

[Naiad]: https://naiad.neptune
```

`ignore` also accepts a list of rules:

```markdown
<!--lint ignore no-unused-definitions definition-case-->

[Naiad]: https://naiad.neptune
```

> 👉 **Note**: you’ll typically need blank lines between HTML comments and other
> constructs.
> More info is available at the package that handles comments,
> [`remark-message-control`][remark-message-control].

> 💡 **Tip**: MDX comments are supported when [`remark-mdx`][remark-mdx] is
> used:
>
> ```mdx
> {/* lint ignore no-unused-definitions definition-case */}
> ```

## Examples

### Example: check markdown on the API

The following example checks that markdown code style is consistent and follows
some best practices.
It also reconfigures a rule.
First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install vfile-reporter remark remark-preset-lint-consistent remark-preset-lint-recommended remark-lint-list-item-indent --save-dev
```

Then create a module `example.js` that contains:

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLintListItemIndent from 'remark-lint-list-item-indent'
import remarkPresetLintConsistent from 'remark-preset-lint-consistent'
import remarkPresetLintRecommended from 'remark-preset-lint-recommended'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await remark()
  // Check that markdown is consistent.
  .use(remarkPresetLintConsistent)
  // Few recommended rules.
  .use(remarkPresetLintRecommended)
  // `remark-lint-list-item-indent` is configured with `one` in the

Running that with `node example.js` yields:

### Example: check and format markdown on the API

remark lint rules *check* markdown.
[`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify] (used in remark) *formats* markdown.
When you configure lint rules and use remark to format markdown, you must
manually synchronize their configuration:

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLintEmphasisMarker from 'remark-lint-emphasis-marker'
import remarkLintStrongMarker from 'remark-lint-strong-marker'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await remark()
  .use(remarkLintEmphasisMarker, '*')
  .use(remarkLintStrongMarker, '*')
  .use({
    settings: {emphasis: '*', strong: '*'} // `remark-stringify` settings.
  })
  .process('_Hello_, __world__!')

console.error(reporter(file))
console.log(String(file))
```

Yields:

```text
    1:1-1:8  warning  Emphasis should use `*` as a marker  emphasis-marker  remark-lint
  1:10-1:19  warning  Strong should use `*` as a marker    strong-marker    remark-lint

⚠ 2 warnings
```

```markdown
*Hello*, **world**!
```

Observe that the lint rules check the input and afterwards remark formats using
asterisks.
If that output was given the the processor, the lint rules would be satisfied.

### Example: check markdown on the CLI

This example checks markdown with [`remark-cli`][remark-cli].
It assumes you’re in a Node.js package.
First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install remark-cli remark-preset-lint-consistent remark-preset-lint-recommended remark-lint-list-item-indent --save-dev
```

Then add an npm script to your `package.json`:

```js
  /* … */
  "scripts": {
    /* … */
    "check": "remark . --quiet --frail",
    /* … */
  },
  /* … */
```

> 💡 **Tip**: add ESLint and such in the `check` script too.

Observe that the above change adds a `check` script, which can be run with
`npm run check`.
It runs remark on all markdown files (`.`), shows only warnings and errors
(`--quiet`), and exits as failed on warnings (`--frail`).
Run `./node_modules/.bin/remark --help` for more info on the CLI.

Now add a `remarkConfig` to your `package.json` to configure remark:

```js
  /* … */
  "remarkConfig": {
    "plugins": [
      "remark-preset-lint-consistent", // Check that markdown is consistent.
      "remark-preset-lint-recommended", // Few recommended rules.
      // `remark-lint-list-item-indent` is configured with `one` in the
      // recommended preset, but if we’d prefer something else, it can be
      // reconfigured:
      [
        "remark-lint-list-item-indent",
        "tab"
      ]
    ]
  },
  /* … */
```

> 👉 **Note**: you must remove the comments in the above examples when
> copy/pasting them, as comments are not supported in `package.json` files.

Finally run the npm script to check markdown files in your project:

```sh
npm run check
```

### Example: check and format markdown on the CLI

remark lint rules *check* markdown.
The CLI can *format* markdown.
You can combine these features but have to manually synchronize their
configuration.
Please first follow the previous example (checking markdown on the CLI) and then
change the npm script:

```js
  /* … */
  "scripts": {
    /* … */
    "format": "remark . --frail --output --quiet",
    /* … */
  },
  /* … */
```

The script is now called `format` to reflect what it does.
It now includes an `--output` flag, which means it will overwrite existing files
with changes.

Update `remarkConfig`:

```js
  /* … */
  "remarkConfig": {
    "settings": {
      "emphasis": "*",
      "strong": "*"
    },
    "plugins": [
      "remark-preset-lint-consistent",
      "remark-preset-lint-recommended",
      ["remark-lint-list-item-indent", "tab"]
      ["remark-lint-emphasis-marker", "*"],
      ["remark-lint-strong-marker", "*"]
    ]
  },
  /* … */
```

This now includes `settings`, which configures
[`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify], and explicitly prefers asterisks
for emphasis and strong.
Install the new dependencies:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-emphasis-marker remark-lint-strong-marker --save-dev
```

Finally run the npm script to format markdown files in your project:

```sh
npm run format
```

> 👉 **Note**: running `npm run format` now checks *and* formats your files.
> The first time you run it, assuming you have underscores for emphasis and
> strong, it would first warn and then format.
> The second time you run it, no warnings should appear.

## Integrations

* [`vscode-remark-lint`](https://github.com/drewbourne/vscode-remark-lint)
  ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com))
  — use `remark-lint` from Visual Studio Code
* [`SublimeLinter-contrib-remark-lint`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-remark-lint)
  ([Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com))
  — use `remark-lint` from Sublime Text
* [`ale`](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)
  ([Vim](https://www.vim.org))
  — use `remark-lint` from Vim
* [`jest-runner-remark`](https://github.com/keplersj/jest-runner-remark)
  ([Jest](https://jestjs.io))
  — use remark with Jest

## Syntax

Markdown is parsed by [`remark-parse`][remark-parse] (included in `remark`)
according to CommonMark.
You can combine it with other plugins to add syntax extensions.
Notable examples that deeply integrate with it are
[`remark-gfm`][remark-gfm],
[`remark-mdx`][remark-mdx],
[`remark-frontmatter`][remark-frontmatter],
[`remark-math`][remark-math], and
[`remark-directive`][remark-directive].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `remark-lint@9`, compatible
with Node.js 16.

## Security

Use of `remark-lint` does not change the tree so there are no openings for
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
Messages from linting rules may be hidden from user content though, causing
builds to fail or pass.
