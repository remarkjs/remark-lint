## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that fenced code markers are consistent.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | ``'`'`` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-fenced-code-marker
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintFencedCodeMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-fenced-code-marker@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintFencedCodeMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-fenced-code-marker@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintFencedCodeMarker from 'remark-lint-fenced-code-marker'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintFencedCodeMarker)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-fenced-code-marker example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-fenced-code-marker",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintFencedCodeMarker`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintFencedCodeMarker[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'consistent'`) are accepted:

*   ``'`'``
    â€” prefer grave accents
*   `'~'`
    â€” prefer tildes
*   `'consistent'`
    â€” detect the first used style and warn when further fenced code differs

## Recommendation

Tildes are extremely uncommon.
Due to this, itâ€™s recommended to configure this rule with ``'`'``.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
formats fenced code with grave accents by default.
Pass
[`fence: '~'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsfence)
to always use tildes.
