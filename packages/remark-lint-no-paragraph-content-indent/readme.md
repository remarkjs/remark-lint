## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that content in paragraphs is not
indented.

## Presets

This rule is not included in a preset maintained here.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-paragraph-content-indent
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintNoParagraphContentIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-no-paragraph-content-indent@4?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintNoParagraphContentIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-no-paragraph-content-indent@4?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintNoParagraphContentIndent from 'remark-lint-no-paragraph-content-indent'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintNoParagraphContentIndent)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-no-paragraph-content-indent example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-no-paragraph-content-indent",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintNoParagraphContentIndent`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintNoParagraphContentIndent[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

Indenting further lines in a paragraph has no effect.
Due to this, itâ€™s recommended to turn this rule on.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
Alpha

Bravo
Charlie.
**Delta**.

*   Echo
    Foxtrot.

> Golf
> Hotel.

`india()`
juliett.

-   `kilo()`
    lima.

-   `mike()` - november.
