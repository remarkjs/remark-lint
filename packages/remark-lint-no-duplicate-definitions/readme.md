## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that identifiers are defined once.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions from 'remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

It’s a mistake when the same identifier is defined multiple times.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
[foo]: bar
[baz]: qux
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
[foo]: bar
[foo]: qux
```

###### Out

```text
2:1-2:11: Do not use definitions with the same identifier (1:1)
```

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
