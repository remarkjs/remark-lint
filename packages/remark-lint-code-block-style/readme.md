## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that code blocks are consistent.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'fenced'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-code-block-style
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintCodeBlockStyle from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-code-block-style@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintCodeBlockStyle from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-code-block-style@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintCodeBlockStyle from 'remark-lint-code-block-style'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintCodeBlockStyle)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-code-block-style example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-code-block-style",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintCodeBlockStyle`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintCodeBlockStyle[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'consistent'`) are accepted:

*   `'fenced'`
    â€” prefer fenced code blocks:
    ````markdown
    ```js
    code()
    ```
    ````
*   `'indented'`
    â€” prefer indented code blocks:
    ```markdown
        code()
    ```
*   `'consistent'`
    â€” detect the first used style and warn when further code blocks differ

## Recommendation

Indentation in markdown is complex, especially because lists and indented
code can interfere in unexpected ways.
Fenced code has more features than indented code: importantly, specifying a
programming language.
Since CommonMark took the idea of fenced code from GFM, fenced code became
widely supported.
Due to this, itâ€™s recommended to configure this rule with `'fenced'`.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
formats code blocks as fenced code when they have a language flag and as
indented code otherwise.
Pass
[`fences: true`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsfences)
to always use fenced code.

## Examples
