## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that strong markers are consistent.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'*'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-strong-marker
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintStrongMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-strong-marker@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintStrongMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-strong-marker@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintStrongMarker from 'remark-lint-strong-marker'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintStrongMarker)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-strong-marker example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-strong-marker",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintStrongMarker`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintStrongMarker[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'consistent'`) are accepted:

*   `'*'`
    â€” prefer asterisks
*   `'_'`
    â€” prefer underscores
*   `'consistent'`
    â€” detect the first used style and warn when further strong differs

## Recommendation

Underscores and asterisks work slightly different: asterisks can form strong
in more cases than underscores.
Because underscores are sometimes used to represent normal underscores inside
words, there are extra rules supporting that.
Asterisks can also be used as the marker of more constructs than underscores:
lists.
Due to having simpler parsing rules, looking more like syntax, and that they
can be used for more constructs, itâ€™s recommended to prefer asterisks.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
formats strong with asterisks by default.
Pass
[`strong: '_'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsstrong)
to always use underscores.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
**foo** and **bar**.
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `also-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
__foo__ and __bar__.
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
**foo** and __bar__.
```

###### Out

```text
1:13-1:20: Strong should use `*` as a marker
```

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'*'`.

###### In

```markdown
**foo**.
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'_'`.

###### In

```markdown
__foo__.
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

When configured with `'ðŸ’©'`.

###### Out

```text
1:1: Incorrect strong marker `ðŸ’©`: use either `'consistent'`, `'*'`, or `'_'`
```
