## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

not more.

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintHardBreakSpaces from 'remark-lint-hard-break-spaces'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintHardBreakSpaces)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-hard-break-spaces example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-hard-break-spaces",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintHardBreakSpaces`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintHardBreakSpaces[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

Less than two spaces do not create a hard breaks and more than two spaces
have no effect.
Due to this, itâ€™s recommended to turn this rule on.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: `Â·` represents a space.

```markdown
Lorem ipsumÂ·Â·
dolor sit amet
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: `Â·` represents a space.

```markdown
Lorem ipsumÂ·Â·Â·
dolor sit amet.
```

###### Out

```text
1:12-2:1: Use two spaces for hard line breaks
```
