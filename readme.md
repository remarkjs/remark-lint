[**remark**][remark] plugins to lint Markdown.

Another linter?
Yes.
Ensuring the Markdown you (and contributors) write is of great quality will
provide better rendering in all the different markdown parsers, and makes sure
less refactoring is needed afterwards.

What is quality?
That’s up to you, but there are sensible [presets][].

`remark-lint` is built on [**remark**][remark], a powerful Markdown processor
powered by [plugins][remark-plugins] (such as these).

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint
```

## CLI

![][screenshot]

Use `remark-lint` with [`remark-cli`][cli] through a
[preset][preset-recommended].

```sh
npm install --save-dev remark-cli remark-preset-lint-recommended
```

Then, configure **remark** in your `package.json`:

```js
  // …
  "scripts": {
    "lint-md": "remark ."
  },
  // …
  "remarkConfig": {
    "plugins": ["remark-preset-lint-recommended"]
  }
  // …
```

Let’s say there’s an `example.md` that looks as follows:

```markdown
* Hello

[World][]
```

Now, running our `lint-md` script with `npm run lint-md` yields:

```txt
example.md
       1:3  warning  Incorrect list-item indent: add 2 spaces  list-item-indent
  3:1-3:10  warning  Found reference to undefined definition   no-undefined-references
⚠ 2 warnings
```

See [`doc/rules.md`][rules] for what those warnings are (and how to turn them
off).

## API

Use `remark-lint` together with [`remark`][api]:

```sh
npm install remark remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide
```

Let’s say `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var remark = require('remark')
var styleGuide = require('remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide')

var file = remark()
  .use(styleGuide)
  .processSync('_Hello world_')

console.log(report(file))
```

Now, running `node example.js` yields:

```txt
  1:1-1:14  warning  Emphasis should use `*` as a marker  emphasis-marker  remark-lint

⚠ 1 warning
```

## Configuring `remark-lint`

`remark-lint` is a **remark** plugin and when used on the CLI supports
configuration through its [configuration files][cli].

An example `.remarkrc` file could look as follows:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "remark-preset-lint-recommended",
    ["remark-lint-list-item-indent", false]
  ]
}
```

The preset turns on `remark-lint-list-item-indent`, but setting a plugin to
`false` later turns it off again.

Using our `example.md` from before:

```markdown
* Hello

[World][]
```

Now, running `npm run lint-md` yields:

```bash
example.md
   3:1-3:10  warning  Found reference to undefined definition   no-undefined-references  remark-lint

⚠ 2 warnings
```

You can also provide configuration comments to turn a rule on or off inside a
file.
Note that you cannot change a setting, such as `maximum-line-length`, just
whether messages are shown or not.
Read more about configuration comments in
[`remark-message-control`][message-control]s documentation.

The following file will warn twice for the duplicate headings:

```markdown
# Hello

## Hello

### Hello
```

The following file will warn once (the second heading is ignored, but the third
is enabled again):

```markdown
# Hello

<!--lint disable no-duplicate-headings-->

## Hello

<!--lint enable no-duplicate-headings-->

### Hello
```

> **Note**: You’ll need the blank lines between comments and other nodes!

## Using remark to fix your Markdown

[`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify] can format markdown syntax.
It ensures a single style is used: list items use one type of bullet (`*`, `-`,
`+`), emphasis (`*` or `_`) and importance (`__` or `**`) use a standard marker,
table fences are aligned, [and more][remark-stringify-options].

###### Example

If you `require('remark')`, [`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify] is included
unless an output format other than markdown (such as HTML) is defined.

Say we have the following file, `example.js`, showing how formatting rules can
be used:

```js
var report = require('vfile-reporter');
var remark = require('remark');
var emphasisMarker = require('remark-lint-emphasis-marker');
var strongMarker = require('remark-lint-strong-marker');

remark()
  .use(emphasisMarker, '*')
  .use(strongMarker, '*')
  // ^ two `remark-lint` rules.
  .use({
    settings: {emphasis: '*', strong: '*'}
    // ^ `remark-stringify` settings.
  })
  .process('_Hello_, __world__!', function (err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file));
    console.log(String(file));
  });
```

Now, running `node example` yields warnings and a formatted file:

```txt
    1:1-1:8  warning  Emphasis should use `*` as a marker  emphasis-marker  remark-lint
  1:10-1:19  warning  Strong should use `*` as a marker    strong-marker    remark-lint

⚠ 2 warnings
*Hello*, **world**!
```

###### Example

If you’re using [`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify] explicitly, you can pass
options like any other plugin, like so:

```js
var report = require('vfile-reporter');
var unified = require('unified');
var parse = require('remark-parse');
var stringify = require('remark-stringify');
var emphasisMarker = require('remark-lint-emphasis-marker');
var strongMarker = require('remark-lint-strong-marker');

unified()
  .use(parse)
  .use(emphasisMarker, '*')
  .use(strongMarker, '*')
  // ^ two `remark-lint` rules.
  .use(stringify, {emphasis: '*', strong: '*'})
  // ^ `remark-stringify` with settings.
  .process('_Hello_, __world__!', function (err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file));
    console.log(String(file));
  });
```

Now, when running `node example`, this results in the same output as the
previous example.

###### Example

If you’re using [`remark-cli`][cli], [`remark-stringify`][remark-stringify] is
included unless an output format other than markdown (such as HTML) is defined.
In this case you can configure `remark-stringify` settings using the [`-s,
--settings`][cli-settings] flag or a `"settings"` field in [remark configuration
files][cli-config].

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
_Hello_, __world__!
```

And our `package.json` looks as follows:

```js
  // …
  "remarkConfig": {
    "settings": {
      "emphasis": "*",
      "strong": "*"
    },
    "plugins": [
      "remark-lint-emphasis-marker",
      "remark-lint-strong-marker"
    ]
  }
  // …
```

Now, running `remark example.md` yields warnings and a formatted file:

```txt
*Hello*, **world**!
example.md
    1:1-1:8  warning  Emphasis should use `*` as a marker  emphasis-marker  remark-lint
  1:10-1:19  warning  Strong should use `*` as a marker    strong-marker    remark-lint

⚠ 2 warnings
```

> Note: running `remark example.md -o` or `remark example.md --output`
> overwrites `example.md` and formats it.
> So, if you’d run that twice (the first pass lints and fixes the Markdown, the
> second pass checks it again), you’d see the output `example.md: written` as
> all warnings are now fixed.

## Security

Use of `remark-lint` does not mutate the tree so there are no openings for
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
Messages from linting rules may be hidden from user content though, causing
builds to fail or pass, or changing a report.

## Related

*   [`remark-validate-links`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-validate-links)
    — Validate if links point to existing headings and files in markdown
