## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that tables have initial and final
delimiters.
Tables are a GFM feature enabled with
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm).

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-table-pipes
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintTablePipes from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-table-pipes@4?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintTablePipes from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-table-pipes@4?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintTablePipes from 'remark-lint-table-pipes'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintTablePipes)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-table-pipes example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-table-pipes",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintTablePipes`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintTablePipes[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

While tables donâ€™t require initial or final delimiters (pipes before the
first and after the last cells in a row), it arguably does look weird.

## Fix

[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)
formats all tables with initial and final delimiters.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: this example uses GFM ([`remark-gfm`][gfm]).

```markdown
| A     | B     |
| ----- | ----- |
| Alpha | Bravo |
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: this example uses GFM ([`remark-gfm`][gfm]).

```markdown
A     | B
----- | -----
Alpha | Bravo
```

###### Out

```text
1:1: Missing initial pipe in table fence
1:10: Missing final pipe in table fence
3:1: Missing initial pipe in table fence
3:14: Missing final pipe in table fence
```
