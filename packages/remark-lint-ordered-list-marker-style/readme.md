Warn when the list item marker style of ordered lists violate a given style.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'.'`, or `')'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used list style and warns when subsequent
lists use different styles.

Note: `)` is only supported in CommonMark.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| ------ | ------- |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'.'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) | `'.'` |

## Example

```markdown
1.  Foo

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-style
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 ...
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ...
     "lint",
+    "lint-ordered-list-marker-style",
     ...
   ]
 }
 ...
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-ordered-list-marker-style readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark');
 var report = require('vfile-reporter');

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-style'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file));
   });
```
