## What is this?

This package checks that referenced definitions are defined.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check for broken references.

## Presets

This plugin is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Options |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][github-gist-esm].
In Node.js (version 16+),
install with [npm][npm-install]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-undefined-references
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import remarkLintNoUndefinedReferences from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-no-undefined-references@5'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintNoUndefinedReferences from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-no-undefined-references@5?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintNoUndefinedReferences from 'remark-lint-no-undefined-references'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await read('example.md')

await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkLint)
  .use(remarkLintNoUndefinedReferences)
  .use(remarkStringify)
  .process(file)

console.error(reporter(file))
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --frail --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-no-undefined-references .
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-no-undefined-references",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
It exports the [TypeScript][typescript] type
[`Options`][api-options].
The default export is
[`remarkLintNoUndefinedReferences`][api-remark-lint-no-undefined-references].

### `unified().use(remarkLintNoUndefinedReferences[, options])`

Warn when undefined definitions are referenced.

###### Parameters

* `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
  â€” configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer` from `unified`][github-unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

* `allow` (`Array<RegExp | string>`, optional)
  â€” list of values to allow between `[` and `]`
* `allowShortcutLink` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
  â€” allow shortcut references, which are just brackets such as `[text]`

## Recommendation

Shortcut references use an implicit syntax that could also occur as plain
text.
To illustrate,
it is reasonable to expect an author adding `[â€¦]` to abbreviate some text
somewhere in a document:

```markdown
> Some [â€¦] quote.
```

This isnâ€™t a problem,
but it might become one when an author later adds a definition:

```markdown
Some new text [â€¦][].

[â€¦]: #read-more
```

The second author might expect only their newly added text to form a link,
but their changes also result in a link for the text by the first author.

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`remark-lint-no-undefined-references@5`,
compatible with Node.js 16.
