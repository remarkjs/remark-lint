## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that the ‚Äúindent‚Äù after a GFM tasklist
checkbox is a single space.

## Presets

This rule is not included in a preset maintained here.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-checkbox-content-indent
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintCheckboxContentIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-checkbox-content-indent@4?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintCheckboxContentIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-checkbox-content-indent@4?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintCheckboxContentIndent from 'remark-lint-checkbox-content-indent'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintCheckboxContentIndent)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-checkbox-content-indent example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 ‚Ä¶
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ‚Ä¶
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-checkbox-content-indent",
     ‚Ä¶
   ]
 }
 ‚Ä¶
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintCheckboxContentIndent`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintCheckboxContentIndent[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no accepted options.

## Recommendation

GFM allows zero or more spaces and tabs after checkboxes.
No space at all arguably looks rather ugly:

```markdown
* [x]Pluto
```

More that one space is superfluous:

```markdown
* [x]   Jupiter
```

Due to this, it‚Äôs recommended to turn this rule on.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
formats checkboxes and the content after them with a single space between.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

> üëâ **Note**: this example uses GFM ([`remark-gfm`][gfm]).

```markdown
- [ ] List item
+  [x] List Item
*   [X] List item
-    [ ] List item
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

> üëâ **Note**: this example uses GFM ([`remark-gfm`][gfm]).

```markdown
- [ ] List item
+ [x]  List item
* [X]   List item
- [ ]    List item
```

###### Out

```text
2:7-2:8: Checkboxes should be followed by a single character
3:7-3:9: Checkboxes should be followed by a single character
4:7-4:10: Checkboxes should be followed by a single character
```
