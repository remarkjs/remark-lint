Warn when shell code is prefixed by `$` (dollar sign) characters.

Ignores indented code blocks and fenced code blocks without language flag.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/master/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Example

##### `ok.md`

###### In

````markdown
```bash
echo a
```

```sh
echo a
echo a > file
```

```zsh
$ echo a
a
$ echo a > file
```

Some empty code:

```command
```

It’s fine to use dollars in non-shell code.

```js
$('div').remove();
```
````

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

````markdown
```sh
$ echo a
```

```bash
$ echo a
$ echo a > file
```
````

###### Out

```text
1:1-3:4: Do not use dollar signs before shell commands
5:1-8:4: Do not use dollar signs before shell commands
```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-shell-dollars
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-no-shell-dollars",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-no-shell-dollars readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-no-shell-dollars'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
