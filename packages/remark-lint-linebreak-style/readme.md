## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that line endings are consistent.

## Presets

This rule is not included in a preset maintained here.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-linebreak-style
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintLinebreakStyle from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-linebreak-style@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintLinebreakStyle from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-linebreak-style@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintLinebreakStyle from 'remark-lint-linebreak-style'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintLinebreakStyle)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-linebreak-style example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 ‚Ä¶
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ‚Ä¶
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-linebreak-style",
     ‚Ä¶
   ]
 }
 ‚Ä¶
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintLinebreakStyle`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintLinebreakStyle[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'consistent'`) are accepted:

*   `'unix'`
    ‚Äî prefer Unix line endings (`\n`, `‚êä`):
*   `'window'`
    ‚Äî prefer Windows line endings (`\r\n`, `‚êç‚êä`):
*   `'consistent'`
    ‚Äî detect the first used style and warn when further line endings differ

## Recommendation

In Git projects, you can configure it to automatically switch between line
endings based on who checks the repo out.
In other places, you might manually want to force that one or the other is
used, in which case this rule can be used and configured.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
always uses Unix linebreaks.

## Examples

##### `ok-consistent-as-windows.md`

###### In

> üëâ **Note**: `‚êç‚êä` represents a carriage return and a line feed.

```markdown
Alpha‚êç‚êä
Bravo‚êç‚êä
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `ok-consistent-as-unix.md`

###### In

> üëâ **Note**: `‚êä` represents a line feed.

```markdown

Bravo‚êä
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok-unix.md`

When configured with `'unix'`.

###### In

> üëâ **Note**: `‚êç‚êä` represents a carriage return and a line feed.

```markdown

```

###### Out

```text

```

##### `not-ok-windows.md`

When configured with `'windows'`.

###### In

> üëâ **Note**: `‚êä` represents a line feed.

```markdown

```
