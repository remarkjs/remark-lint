## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that heading ranks increment with one
at a time.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-heading-increment
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintHeadingIncrement from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-heading-increment@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintHeadingIncrement from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-heading-increment@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintHeadingIncrement from 'remark-lint-heading-increment'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintHeadingIncrement)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-heading-increment example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-heading-increment",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintHeadingIncrement`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintHeadingIncrement[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

While markdown is not only used for HTML, HTML accessibility guidelines
state that headings should increment by one at a time.
As in, say the previous heading had a rank of 2 (so `<h2>`), then the
following heading that is to be considered “inside” it should have a rank of
3 (`<h3>`).
Due to this, it’s recommended that when HTML output is a goal of the
document, that this rule is turned on.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
# Alpha

## Bravo
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
# Charlie

### Delta
```

###### Out

```text
3:1-3:10: Heading levels should increment by one level at a time
```

## Compatibility
