## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-preset-lint-consistent
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
+  "plugins": ["preset-lint-consistent"]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u preset-lint-consistent readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
+  .use(require('remark-preset-lint-consistent'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
