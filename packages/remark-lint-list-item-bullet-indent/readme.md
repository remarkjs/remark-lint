## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that list items are not indented.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-list-item-bullet-indent
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintListItemBulletIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-list-item-bullet-indent@4?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintListItemBulletIndent from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-list-item-bullet-indent@4?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintListItemBulletIndent from 'remark-lint-list-item-bullet-indent'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintListItemBulletIndent)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-list-item-bullet-indent example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-list-item-bullet-indent",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintListItemBulletIndent`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintListItemBulletIndent[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

There is no specific handling of indented list items (or anything else) in
markdown.
While it is possible to use an indent to align ordered lists on their marker:

```markdown
  1. One
 10. Ten
100. Hundred
```

â€¦such a style is uncommon and a bit hard to maintain: adding a 10th item
means 9 other items have to change (more arduous, while unlikely, would be
the 100th item).
Hence, itâ€™s recommended to not indent items and to turn this rule on.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
formats all items without indent.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
Paragraph.

* List item
* List item
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: `Â·` represents a space.

```markdown
Paragraph.

Â·* List item
Â·* List item
```

###### Out

```text
3:2: Incorrect indentation before bullet: remove 1 space
4:2: Incorrect indentation before bullet: remove 1 space
```
