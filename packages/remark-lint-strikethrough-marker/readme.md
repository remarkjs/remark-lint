## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that the number of strikethrough
markers is consistent.
Strikethrough is a GFM feature enabled with
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm).

## Presets

This rule is not included in a preset maintained here.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-strikethrough-marker
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintStrikethroughMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-strikethrough-marker@2?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintStrikethroughMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-strikethrough-marker@2?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintStrikethroughMarker from 'remark-lint-strikethrough-marker'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintStrikethroughMarker)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-strikethrough-marker example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-strikethrough-marker",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintStrikethroughMarker`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintStrikethroughMarker[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'consistent'`) are accepted:

*   `'~'`
    â€” prefer one strikethrough marker
*   `'~~'`
    â€” prefer two strikethrough markers
*   `'consistent'`
    â€” detect the first used style and warn when further strikethrough differs

## Recommendation

GitHub flavored markdown (GFM) specifies that two tildes should be used,
but `github.com` allows one tilde everywhere.
Itâ€™s recommended to use two tildes.

## Fix

[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)
formats all strikethrough with two tildes.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'~'`.

###### In

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: this example uses GFM ([`remark-gfm`][gfm]).

```markdown
~foo~
```

###### Out

##### `not-ok.md`

```
