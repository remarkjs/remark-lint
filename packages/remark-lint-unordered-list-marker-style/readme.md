Warn when the list item marker style of unordered lists violate a given
style.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, or `'+'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used list style and warns when subsequent
lists use different styles.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify)
formats unordered lists using `-` (hyphen-minus) by default.
Pass
[`bullet: '*'` or `bullet: '+'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify#optionsbullet)
to use `*` (asterisk) or `+` (plus sign) instead.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-unordered-list-marker-style
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-unordered-list-marker-style",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-unordered-list-marker-style readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-unordered-list-marker-style'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
