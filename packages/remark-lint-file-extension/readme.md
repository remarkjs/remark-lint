## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that file extensions are `md`.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'md'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-file-extension
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintFileExtension from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-file-extension@2?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintFileExtension from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-file-extension@2?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintFileExtension from 'remark-lint-file-extension'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintFileExtension)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-file-extension example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-file-extension",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintFileExtension`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintFileExtension[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'md'`) are accepted:

*   `string` (example `'markdown'`)
    â€” preferred file extension (no dot)

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: does not warn when files have no file extensions (such as
> `AUTHORS` or `LICENSE`).

## Recommendation

Use `md` as itâ€™s the most common.
Also use `md` when your markdown contains common syntax extensions (such as
GFM, frontmatter, or math).
Do not use `md` for MDX: use `mdx` instead.

## Examples

##### `readme.md`

###### Out

No messages.

##### `readme`

###### Out

No messages.

##### `readme.mkd`

###### Out

```text
1:1: Incorrect extension: use `md`
```

##### `readme.mkd`

When configured with `'mkd'`.

###### Out

No messages.
