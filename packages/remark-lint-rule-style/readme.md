## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that rules (thematic breaks, horizontal
rules) are consistent.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'---'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-rule-style
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintRuleStyle from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-rule-style@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintRuleStyle from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-rule-style@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintRuleStyle from 'remark-lint-rule-style'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintRuleStyle)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-rule-style example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-rule-style",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintRuleStyle`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintRuleStyle[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'consistent'`) are accepted:

*   `string` (example: `'** * **'`, `'___'`)
    â€” thematic break to prefer
*   `'consistent'`
    â€” detect the first used style and warn when further rules differ

## Recommendation

Rules consist of a `*`, `-`, or `_` character, which occurs at least three
times with nothing else except for arbitrary spaces or tabs on a single line.
Using spaces, tabs, and more than three markers seems unnecessary work to
type out.
Because asterisks can be used as a marker for more markdown constructs,
itâ€™s recommended to use that for rules (and lists, emphasis, strong) too.
Due to this, itâ€™s recommended to pass `'***'`.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
formats rules with `***` by default.
There are three settings to control rules:

*   [`rule`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsrule)
    (default: `'*'`) â€” marker
*   [`ruleRepetition`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsrulerepetition)
    (default: `3`) â€” repetitions
*   [`ruleSpaces`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsrulespaces)
    (default: `false`) â€” use spaces between markers

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'* * *'`.

###### In

```markdown
* * *

* * *
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'_______'`.

###### In

```markdown
_______

_______
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
***

* * *
```

###### Out

```text
3:1-3:6: Rules should use `***`
```

##### `not-ok.md`

When configured with `'ðŸ’©'`.

###### Out

```text
1:1: Incorrect preferred rule style: provide a correct markdown rule or `'consistent'`
```
