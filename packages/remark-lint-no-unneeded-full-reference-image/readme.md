Warn when full reference images are used that could be collapsed.

Full references (such as `[Remark][remark]`) can also be written as a
collapsed reference (`[Remark][]`) if normalising the reference text yields
the label.

## Presets

This rule is not included in any default preset

## Example

##### `valid.md`

###### In

```markdown
![alpha][]
![Bravo][]
![Charlie][delta]
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `invalid.md`

###### In

```markdown
![alpha][alpha]
![Bravo][bravo]
![charlie][Charlie]
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:16: Remove the image label as it matches the reference text
2:1-2:16: Remove the image label as it matches the reference text
3:1-3:20: Remove the image label as it matches the reference text
```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-unneeded-full-reference-image
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 ...
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     ...
     "lint",
+    "lint-no-unneeded-full-reference-image",
     ...
   ]
 }
 ...
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-no-unneeded-full-reference-image readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark');
 var report = require('vfile-reporter');

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-no-unneeded-full-reference-image'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file));
   });
```
