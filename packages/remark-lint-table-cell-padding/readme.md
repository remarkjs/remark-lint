## What is this?

This package checks table cell padding.
Tables are a GFM feature enabled with [`remark-gfm`][github-remark-gfm].

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that tables are consistent.

## Presets

This plugin is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Options |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'padded'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][github-gist-esm].
In Node.js (version 16+),
install with [npm][npm-install]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-table-cell-padding
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import remarkLintTableCellPadding from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-table-cell-padding@5'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintTableCellPadding from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-table-cell-padding@5?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintTableCellPadding from 'remark-lint-table-cell-padding'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await read('example.md')

await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkLint)
  .use(remarkLintTableCellPadding)
  .use(remarkStringify)
  .process(file)

console.error(reporter(file))
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --frail --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-table-cell-padding .
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-table-cell-padding",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
It exports the [TypeScript][typescript] types
[`Options`][api-options] and
[`Style`][api-style].
The default export is
[`remarkLintTableCellPadding`][api-remark-lint-table-cell-padding].

### `unified().use(remarkLintTableCellPadding[, options])`

Warn when GFM table cells are padded inconsistently.

###### Parameters

* `options`
  ([`Options`][api-options], [`Style`][api-style], or `'consistent'`,
  default: `'consistent'`)
  — configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer` from `unified`][github-unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Properties

* `stringLength` (`(value: string) => number`, optional)
  — function to detect cell size
* `style` ([`Style`][api-style] or `'consistent'`, optional)
  — preferred style or whether to detect the first style

### `Style`

Style (TypeScript type).

* `'compact'`
  — prefer zero spaces between pipes and content
* `'padded'`
  — prefer at least one space between pipes and content

###### Type

```ts
type Style = 'compact' | 'padded'
```

## Recommendation

It’s recommended to use at least one space between pipes and content for
legibility of the markup (`'padded'`).

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`][github-remark-stringify] with
[`remark-gfm`][github-remark-gfm] formats all table cells as padded by
default.
Pass `tableCellPadding: false` to use a more compact style.

Aligning perfectly in all cases is not possible because whether characters
look aligned or not depends on where the markup is shown.
Some characters (such as emoji or Chinese characters) show smaller or bigger
in different places.
You can pass a `stringLength` function to `remark-gfm`,
to align better for your use case,
in which case this rule must be configured with the same `stringLength`.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`remark-lint-table-cell-padding@5`,
compatible with Node.js 16.
