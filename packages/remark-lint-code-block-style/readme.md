## What is this?

This package checks the style of code blocks.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that the style of code blocks is
consistent.

## Presets

This plugin is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Options |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'fenced'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][github-gist-esm].
In Node.js (version 16+),
install with [npm][npm-install]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-code-block-style
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import remarkLintCodeBlockStyle from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-code-block-style@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintCodeBlockStyle from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-code-block-style@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintCodeBlockStyle from 'remark-lint-code-block-style'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await read('example.md')

await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkLint)
  .use(remarkLintCodeBlockStyle)
  .use(remarkStringify)
  .process(file)

console.error(reporter(file))
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --frail --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-code-block-style .
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-code-block-style",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
It exports the [TypeScript][typescript] types
[`Options`][api-options] and
[`Style`][api-style].
The default export is
[`remarkLintCodeBlockStyle`][api-remark-lint-code-block-style].

### `unified().use(remarkLintCodeBlockStyle[, options])`

Warn when code blocks violate a given style.

###### Parameters

* `options` ([`Options`][api-options], default: `'consistent'`)
  — preferred style or whether to detect the first style and warn for
  further differences

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer` from `unified`][github-unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Type

```ts
type Options = Style | 'consistent'
```

### `Style`

Style (TypeScript type).

###### Type

```ts
type Style = 'indented' | 'fenced'
```

## Recommendation

Indentation in markdown is complex as lists and indented code interfere in
unexpected ways.
Fenced code has more features than indented code: it can specify a
programming language.
Since CommonMark took the idea of fenced code from GFM,
fenced code became widely supported.
Due to this, it’s recommended to configure this rule with `'fenced'`.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`][github-remark-stringify] always formats code blocks as
fenced.
Pass `fences: false` to only use fenced code blocks when they have a
language and as indented code otherwise.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'indented'`.

###### In

```markdown
    alpha()

Paragraph.

    bravo()
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

When configured with `'indented'`.

###### In

````markdown
```
alpha()
```

Paragraph.

```
bravo()
```
````

###### Out

```text
1:1-3:4: Code blocks should be indented
7:1-9:4: Code blocks should be indented
```

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'fenced'`.

###### In

````markdown
```
alpha()
```

Paragraph.

```
bravo()
```
````

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok-fenced.md`

When configured with `'fenced'`.

###### In

```markdown
    alpha()

Paragraph.

    bravo()
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:12: Code blocks should be fenced
5:1-5:12: Code blocks should be fenced
```

##### `not-ok-consistent.md`

###### In

````markdown
    alpha()

Paragraph.

```
bravo()
```
````

###### Out

```text
5:1-7:4: Code blocks should be indented
```

##### `not-ok-incorrect.md`

When configured with `'💩'`.

###### Out

```text
1:1: Incorrect code block style `💩`: use either `'consistent'`, `'fenced'`, or `'indented'`
```

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`remark-lint-code-block-style@3`,
compatible with Node.js 12.
