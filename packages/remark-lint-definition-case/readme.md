## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that the labels used in definitions
are lowercase.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-definition-case
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintDefinitionCase from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-definition-case@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintDefinitionCase from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-definition-case@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintDefinitionCase from 'remark-lint-definition-case'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintDefinitionCase)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-definition-case example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-definition-case",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintDefinitionCase`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintDefinitionCase[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

Definitions and references are matched together regardless of casing.
Using uppercase in labels might incorrectly indicate that casing is of
importance.
Due to this, it’s recommended to use lowercase and turn this rule on.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
[example]: http://example.com "Example Domain"
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
[Example]: http://example.com "Example Domain"
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:47: Do not use uppercase characters in definition labels
```
