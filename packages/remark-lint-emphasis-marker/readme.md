## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that emphasis markers are consistent.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'*'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-emphasis-marker
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintEmphasisMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-emphasis-marker@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintEmphasisMarker from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-emphasis-marker@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintEmphasisMarker from 'remark-lint-emphasis-marker'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintEmphasisMarker)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-emphasis-marker example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-emphasis-marker",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintEmphasisMarker`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintEmphasisMarker[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'consistent'`) are accepted:

*   `'*'`
    â€” prefer asterisks
*   `'_'`
    â€” prefer underscores
*   `'consistent'`
    â€” detect the first used style and warn when further emphasis differs

## Recommendation

Underscores and asterisks work slightly different: asterisks can form
emphasis in more cases than underscores.
Because underscores are sometimes used to represent normal underscores inside
words, there are extra rules supporting that.
Asterisks can also be used as the marker of more constructs than underscores:
lists.
Due to having simpler parsing rules, looking more like syntax, and that they
can be used for more constructs, itâ€™s recommended to prefer asterisks.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
formats emphasis with asterisks by default.
Pass
[`emphasis: '_'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsemphasis)
to always use underscores.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'*'`.

###### In

```markdown
*foo*
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

When configured with `'*'`.

###### In

```markdown
_foo_
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:6: Emphasis should use `*` as a marker
```

##### `ok.md`

When configured with `'_'`.

###### In

```markdown
_foo_
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

When configured with `'_'`.

###### In

```markdown
*foo*
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:6: Emphasis should use `_` as a marker
```

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
*foo*
_bar_
```

###### Out

```text
2:1-2:6: Emphasis should use `*` as a marker
```

##### `not-ok.md`

When configured with `'ðŸ’©'`.

###### Out

```text
1:1: Incorrect emphasis marker `ðŸ’©`: use either `'consistent'`, `'*'`, or `'_'`
```
