## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that ordered list values are consistent.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'one'` |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue from 'remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintOrderedListMarkerValue[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

The following options (default: `'ordered'`) are accepted:

*   `'ordered'`
    â€” values should increment by one from the first item
*   `'single'`
    â€” values should stay the same as the first item
*   `'one'`
    â€” values should always be exactly `1`

## Recommendation

While `'single'` might be the smartest style, as it makes it easier to move
items around without having to renumber everything and doesnâ€™t have
problems with aligning content of the 9th and the 10th item, itâ€™s not used a
lot and arguably looks unnatural.
`'one'` is like `'single'` but forces every list to start at `1`.
While not often needed, starting lists at other values is sometimes useful.
Due to this, `'ordered'` is recommended, although `'single'` is also a viable
choice.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify)
retains the value of the first item and increments further items by default.
Pass
[`incrementListMarker: false`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify#optionsincrementlistmarker)
to not increment further items.

## Examples

5.  Charlie

Unordered lists are not affected by this rule.
