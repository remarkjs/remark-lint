## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that the labels used in definitions
do not use meaningless white space.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-definition-spacing
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintDefinitionSpacing from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-definition-spacing@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintDefinitionSpacing from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-definition-spacing@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintDefinitionSpacing from 'remark-lint-definition-spacing'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintDefinitionSpacing)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-definition-spacing example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-definition-spacing",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintDefinitionSpacing`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintDefinitionSpacing[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

Definitions and references are matched together by collapsing white space.
Using more white space in labels might incorrectly indicate that they are of
importance.
Due to this, it’s recommended to use one space (or a line ending if needed)
and turn this rule on.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
[example domain]: http://example.com "Example Domain"
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

> 👉 **Note**: `·` represents a space.

```markdown
[example····domain]: http://example.com "Example Domain"
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:57: Do not use consecutive whitespace in definition labels
```
