## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that headings with the same text are
used once.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-duplicate-headings
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintNoDuplicateHeadings from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-no-duplicate-headings@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintNoDuplicateHeadings from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-no-duplicate-headings@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintNoDuplicateHeadings from 'remark-lint-no-duplicate-headings'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintNoDuplicateHeadings)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-no-duplicate-headings example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-no-duplicate-headings",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintNoDuplicateHeadings`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintNoDuplicateHeadings[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

Headings having unique text helps screen reader users (who typically use
“jump to heading” features to navigate within a page, which reads headings
out loud).
It also helps because often headings receive automatic unique IDs, and when
the same heading text is used, they are suffixed with a number based on where
they are positioned in the document, which makes linking to them prone to
changes.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
# Foo

## Bar
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
# Foo

## Foo

## [Foo](http://foo.com/bar)
```

###### Out

```text
3:1-3:7: Do not use headings with similar content (1:1)
5:1-5:29: Do not use headings with similar content (3:1)
```
