## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that table cell dividers are aligned.
Tables are a GFM feature enabled with
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm).

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkLintTablePipeAlignment from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintTablePipeAlignment from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintTablePipeAlignment from 'remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintTablePipeAlignment)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-table-pipe-alignment",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintTablePipeAlignment`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintTablePipeAlignment[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Recommendation

While aligning table dividers improves their legibility, it is somewhat
hard to maintain manually, especially for tables with many rows.

## Fix

[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm)
aligns table dividers by default.
Pass
[`tablePipeAlign: false`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm#optionstablepipealign)
to use a more compact style.

Aligning characters is impossible because whether they look aligned or not
depends on where the markup is shown: some characters (such as emoji or
Chinese characters) show smaller or bigger in different places.
You can pass your own
[`stringLength`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm#optionsstringlength)
to `remark-gfm`, in which case this rule must be turned off.

## Examples
